# Social_Media_Control

The basic idea of the project is to control access to Instagram or any other social media app. The app works by the user entering their ID and password for their social media account, and the app then changes their password in that app. This password change is done using Selenium, and the new password generated by the app is encrypted and saved in a database. After a set amount of time, when the user enters their password, it is Decrypted. and provided to the user.
